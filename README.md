# numpy-in-plain-sight

This is how I learned NumPy — not from tutorials, not from AI, not from “ultimate guides”.

Just me, a terminal, and three small projects that built on each other.

No magic. No pretending I knew it all. Just code that works, comments that make sense, and mistakes I left in so Future Me remembers how I got here.

## What’s inside

This repo contains three self-contained projects:

### 1. [`just-numpy`](./just-numpy/)  
The absolute basics:  
→ Creating arrays  
→ Shape, dtype, indexing  
→ Math, stats, reshaping  
→ If you’re starting from zero — start here.

### 2. [`just-numpy-advanced`](./just-numpy-advanced/)  
Where NumPy starts to feel powerful:  
→ Boolean and fancy indexing  
→ Broadcasting (yes, I finally get it)  
→ UFuncs, stacking, random, matrix math  
→ The stuff you keep Googling — now in one place.

### 3. [`just-numpy-data`](./just-numpy-data/)  
Real data, real mess:  
→ Loading CSVs with `genfromtxt`  
→ Handling NaNs, filtering rows, saving cleaned data  
→ Stats, correlations, conditions  
→ And a gentle reminder: sometimes, just use pandas.

## Why this exists

I kept forgetting syntax.  
I kept getting stuck on “why does this work?”  
I didn’t want perfect code — I wanted code that *explained itself*.

So I wrote this for me.  
If it helps you too — cool.  
If not — no pressure.

## How to use

Each folder is independent.

1. Go into any project folder (`just-numpy`, etc.)
2. Make sure you have Python 3.7+
3. Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
